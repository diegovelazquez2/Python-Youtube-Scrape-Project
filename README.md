# Python-Youtube-Scrape-Project

In this project, I used the YouTube API for a web scraping project, where I created a dataset and analyzed the results, of different popular YouTube channels, specifically in the fitness niche. The goal was to answer the following research questions I came up with:

Is there a trend between total number of videos and total subscribers?
Trend between number of videos and total views?
Do older channels seem to have higher subscriber counts?
Do higher viewed videos always seem to have higher like / comment counts?
